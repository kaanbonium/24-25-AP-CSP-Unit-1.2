#   a123_TR_apple_typing_3.py
#   Run code in VS Code to be able to access the images.
#   Example solution:
#      Code connects to the image of an apple.
#      The apple is located on the image of a tree.
#      The apple does not draw a line as it falls.
#      When A is pressed, the letter A appears on the apple.
#      The apple falls to the ground when the A key is pressed.
#      The apple and letter disappear after the apple hits the ground.

#TODO define a function per letter that you will use in your program. Each function should check
